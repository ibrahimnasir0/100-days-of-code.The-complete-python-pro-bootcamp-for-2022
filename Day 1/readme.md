I've decided to join the #100daysofcode challenge (Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022) by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. It is one of the best Python courses that I have come across. ☺️
I am planning to share my progress here so that it can become a motivation for me and others.

Day 1 :
Topic Name:- working with variables to manage data
Today's Project:- BRAND NAME GENERATOR

First it start with Printing ("hello word") as always and then string manipulation, code intelligence and in last one debuging exercise.
After Exercise learn about python input function ,python variable, variable naming and in the last exercise of day I make my first project which is BRAND NAME GENERATOR .

Motivated to complete this challenge. Your suggestions are going to be welcome.
